# Steminist: Empowering Women in STEM

Welcome to Steminist, a platform dedicated to breaking down barriers and inspiring the next generation of female leaders in the STEM field. We are excited to introduce you to our website, created as a final project for Kode with Klossy's Web Development Camp.

## Why Steminist?

**The Gender Disparity in STEM**: It's no secret that there is a significant gender gap in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) field. This disparity exists due to a combination of factors, including the lack of visible role models, persistent stereotypes, and deeply ingrained sexism.

**Empowering Young Females**: Steminist aims to bridge this gap by exposing young females to the exciting world of STEM. We believe that teenagers are uniquely positioned to understand the importance of women in STEM and to become advocates for change.

**Creating Opportunities**: Our website is a resource hub designed to provide new learning opportunities within the STEM community. We want to empower young women with the knowledge and resources they need to pursue STEM careers confidently.

**Equality in STEM**: Giving women equal opportunities in various STEM careers is not just about fairness; it's about unleashing the full potential of the STEM field. Steminist is committed to educating teenagers about the significant contributions women have made in creating space for all of us in the STEM industry.
